The final framework we have decided to look into is VUE 
The Pros of this Framework is:
*The sizing is much smaller because of the ability for the framework to get rid of stuff that is not useful to the project
*Code and component reusability 
*Good for unit-QA testing
QA testing and bugging 
The cons of this Framework is:
*Langauage Barrier
*Reactivity Complexity
*Risk of flexibilty
*Lack of support and outdated
*Limited resources
*Lack of help for unexpoerinced people 
*Lack of UI and integration of outside work
